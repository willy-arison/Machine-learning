# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains machine learning projects focused on image and text classification using various neural network architectures and activation functions.

## Image Classification

* Architectures: ResNet, CNN, and MLP
* Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and our proposed **Geletu-Hoffmann** function
* Datasets:

  * MNIST
  * Fashion MNIST
  * CIFAR-10
  * CIFAR-100
  * SVHN

## Text Classification

* Architecture: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews
* Activation Functions: Including **Geletu-Hoffmann**

## Novel Activation Function

We propose a new activation function called **Geletu-Hoffmann**.
It shows improved accuracy in CNN and LSTM models.

## Frameworks

* PyTorch
* PyTorch Lightning

## Results

Our experiments show that the **Geletu-Hoffmann** function outperforms standard activation functions in image and text classification tasks.
